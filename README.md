## Milestone 5

### Task 2
For flight_origins_destinations.twb I have two versions. Version 2 uses the SUM function, following the instructions. I would be interested to know what benefit there is to using SUM, rather than COUNT (as in v.1). When I use the SUM function, the values on the y-axis don't make any sense and I can't work out how to change them. 

The instructions only ask for a chart showing flight destinations. If a chart showing origins is also required (as suggested by the task title), please let me know and I will add this.

### Task 4
I couldn't see any separate data for inbound/outbound flights, so I have just used Flights(Count), rather than calculating the SUM of inbound and outbound as the instructions state.
